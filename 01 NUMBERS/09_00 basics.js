//here's how to do basic number operations
//addition
console.log(2 + 3);

//substraction
console.log(7 - 1);

//multiplication
console.log(12 * 12);

//division
console.log(9/3);

//decimal numbers or float number
console.log(7 * 0.12);

//exponents
console.log(3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3);
console.log(3 ** 5);

//remainder operator
// 7/4 gives us 1.75, whice means we have .75 of 4 leftover after dividing 7 by 4
// this is just the remainder, and the remainder is .75*4 in this case
console.log(7/4);  //regular division
console.log(7 % 4); //remainder or modulo operator
