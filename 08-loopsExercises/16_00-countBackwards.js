//we've written a lot of code where we do something like "print out all the
//numbers from 0 to 10", which gives us 0, 1, 2, 3, ...,10..but what if we 
//want to start at 10 and go backwards down to 0? write me that program.

for (let i = 10 ; i >= 0; i-- ){
    console.log(i);
}

let j = 10;
while (j >= 0) {
    console.log(j--);

}
